So Gobble Up Your Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. 

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page, waiting to be eaten. 
* Each burger in the `waiting area` has a `Eat me!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the page's right side in to the `devoured area`.
* Each burger in the `devoured area` has a `Back!` button In case a user wants to eat ot again.
* The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
